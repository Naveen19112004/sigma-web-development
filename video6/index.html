    <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
<p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) means making your webpage easy for search engines like Google to understand. A page ranks higher when its title, headings, and content match properly and when semantic HTML tags are used.</p>

<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The <b>title</b> of the page should match the actual topic.</li>
    <li>The <b>headings (h1, h2, h3)</b> should match the content on the page.</li>
    <li>Using <b>semantic tags</b> (header, nav, section, article, footer) helps search engines understand the structure.</li>
    <li><b>Alt text</b> in images helps Google understand image content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lighthouse Tool</h3>
<p>In the browser’s Inspect Tools, the <b>Lighthouse</b> tool checks your website’s SEO, performance, accessibility, and best practices. It gives a score and shows areas to improve. This helps you understand how well your page can appear in search results.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Good SEO means your webpage is clear, organized, and easy for search engines to read. When title, headings, and content match correctly, your page ranks better and becomes more discoverable to users.</p>
1️⃣ SEO actually has two types

You didn’t mention this, but it’s very important:

✔ On-Page SEO

Changes you do inside your website:

Title tags

Meta description

Headings (H1, H2, H3)

Keyword usage

Semantic HTML (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>)

Image alt text

Internal linking

Clean URLs

✔ Off-Page SEO

Things outside your website:

Backlinks from other websites

Social media presence

Domain authority

Brand reputation

Netflix ranks #1 mainly because of HUGE off-page SEO.
2️⃣ SEO considers Core Web Vitals (IMPORTANT)

Google measures:

✔ Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) – loading time
✔ First Input Delay (FID) – interactivity
✔ Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) – stability (no shifting UI)
3️⃣ Meta tags are specifically used for SEO

You mentioned meta tags but didn’t explain them.

Important meta tags:

<meta name="description" content="Watch movies and shows online.">
<meta name="keywords" content="movies, shows, streaming">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


Meta description improves click-through rate.

✔ Google crawls and indexes websites.
✔ SEO is how WE optimize them to rank higher.
Google does not "give SEO"; we do SEO.
