    <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
<p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) means making your webpage easy for search engines like Google to understand. A page ranks higher when its title, headings, and content match properly and when semantic HTML tags are used.</p>

<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The <b>title</b> of the page should match the actual topic.</li>
    <li>The <b>headings (h1, h2, h3)</b> should match the content on the page.</li>
    <li>Using <b>semantic tags</b> (header, nav, section, article, footer) helps search engines understand the structure.</li>
    <li><b>Alt text</b> in images helps Google understand image content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lighthouse Tool</h3>
<p>In the browser’s Inspect Tools, the <b>Lighthouse</b> tool checks your website’s SEO, performance, accessibility, and best practices. It gives a score and shows areas to improve. This helps you understand how well your page can appear in search results.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Good SEO means your webpage is clear, organized, and easy for search engines to read. When title, headings, and content match correctly, your page ranks better and becomes more discoverable to users.</p>
