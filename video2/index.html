      The browser builds the DOM Tree by parsing HTML line-by-line. But it only
      paints the page after blocking JavaScript finishes execution. So body
      elements exist in the DOM before the script, but they appear on screen
      only after the script completes
    </p>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
