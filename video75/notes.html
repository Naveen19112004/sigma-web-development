    ✅ JavaScript: Asynchronous, Promises, Async/Await — Clean Notes
🔹 JavaScript is Asynchronous by Default

JavaScript runs code without waiting for time-taking tasks (API calls, database operations, timers, etc.).
This means the next line of code executes even if the previous task has not finished yet.

🟦 Why Callbacks Are Not Enough

Callbacks do not have any built-in waiting mechanism.
When we keep nesting callbacks inside callbacks, we get the Pyramid of Doom (callback hell):

func1(() => {
    func2(() => {
        func3(() => {
            ...
        })
    })
})


This becomes hard to read, debug, and maintain.

🟩 Promises — The Solution

Promises help us write asynchronous code in a clean and structured way.

A Promise has two outcomes only:

resolve() → success

reject() → failure

A promise cannot resolve and reject both. Once settled, its state cannot change.

We handle promise results using:

.then() → runs when the promise resolves

.catch() → runs when the promise rejects

.finally() → runs always (optional)

🟨 Why Promises Are Better

Promises allow us to “wait” for a task to finish before moving forward.
They provide a cleaner structure and avoid callback hell.

🟧 Async / Await

async and await make promise handling look like synchronous code.

async function run() {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
}


await pauses inside the async function until the promise settles.

🟦 Important Promise Utility Methods
1️⃣ Promise.all([p1, p2, ...])

Waits for all promises to resolve

If any promise rejects → entire Promise.all rejects

Use case: multiple API calls that all must succeed.

2️⃣ Promise.allSettled([p1, p2, ...])

Returns the status and value of every promise

It never rejects, even if some promises fail

Useful when you want results of all promises, successful or failed

3️⃣ Promise.race([p1, p2, ...])

Returns the first promise that settles (resolve or reject)
Use case: timeouts, fastest request, API fallback.

4️⃣ Promise.any([p1, p2, ...])

(This is the one you forgot — the “C” was a confusion)

Returns the first resolved promise

Ignores rejections

Rejects only if all promises fail

5️⃣ Promise.resolve(value)

Creates a promise that resolves immediately.

6️⃣ Promise.reject(error)

Creates a promise that rejects immediately.
